### Data Science

[Predict Breast Cancer with RF, PCA and SVM](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/predict-breast-cancer-with-rf-pca-svm/blob/master/Predict%20Breast%20Cancer%20with%20Random%20Forest%2C%20PCA%20and%20SVM.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">In this project I am going to perform comprehensive EDA on the breast cancer dataset, then transform the data using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and use Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a patient has breast cancer.</div>

[Detect Spam Messages - Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/detect-spam-messages-nlp/blob/master/detect-spam-sms-nlp.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a form that machine learning algorithms can understand. Next I train a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I will classify unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>
